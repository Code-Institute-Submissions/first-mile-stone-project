# First mile stone project

This is my very first webpage, where I used Cloud9 for my workspace and Github to hosted and back up this webpage.
This project is to created a static (front-end only) website for a band.

To reach out for their fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, 
and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability 
to perform at events such as weddings and parties.

## Demo

## UX
